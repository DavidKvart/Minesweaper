# My first Java Script project

this project was created with vanilla javascript and is based on the game MineSweaper. It was created 2 weeks after i started learning programming

## parts of interest 

the most interesting part of this project was the Implementation of the BDS algorithm, which is used in a recursion to search the array for all tiles around the tile press for the expanding part.

### the main difficulty 

the hardest part was actually the front end and how to make the site respond to the data array. I used a multidimention array to control both the value of the tile and the style to be displayed
